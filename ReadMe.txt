               "Put in order" your Desktop!

Hide It! is a program giving you a possibility to "put in order" your 
Desktop by hiding all applications not currently used and windows from 
the desktop and task bar. An access to the hidden applications 
is available through Application Menu of the program Hide It! 
Main advantage of Hide It! is the presence of "memory optimizer" 
(available only for the users of NT-based systems). 
With this, programs not currently in use give maximum 
freedom to physical memory (RAM), unloading their data into 
virtual memory which influences in a positive way operating 
speed of other applications.

Thank you for your interest.
